I am a Senior Research Scientist at [valeo.ai](https://valeoai.github.io/) in Paris, France. My main research focuses on efficient perception (spanning low-shot learning, self-supervised representation learning, and vision foundation models) and scalable generative modeling for vision and language data.

I completed my Ph.D. in 2018 at École des Ponts ParisTech, where I was a member of the [Imagine group](https://imagine-lab.enpc.fr/), under the supervision of [Nikos Komodakis](https://www.csd.uoc.gr/~komod/). The thesis was recognized with two best thesis awards from the [Fondation des Ponts](https://www.fondationdesponts.fr/prix-2019-de-la-meilleure-these-de-lannee/) and Université Paris-Est. I completed my undergraduate degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece.
